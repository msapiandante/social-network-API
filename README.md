# Social Network API

## Description
This project was used to reinforce concepts that I learned in the NoSql module of the bootcamp course. I learned how to create and manipulate data using MongoDB Compass. I also learned how to use Mongoose. I found it interesting and also just a great learning experience to find out how much coding and background work goes into social media websites as well as any web api, really. The project was challenging at times because keeping all the models, controllers and routes clear and connected in correct ways could get confusing at times.
